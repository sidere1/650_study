    abstract = {The aim of the work reported in this paper was to study the characterization of fluid machines (e.g., fans, pumps) as sources of fluid-borne sound in connected pipe or duct systems. Of special interest is the possibility of extending earlier published methods beyond the plane wave region: i.e., to include higher order modes effects. For machines which can be modelled as an acoustic multi-port source, a method which makes it possible to measure the source data is suggested together with a modal decomposition technique. In order to verify and test the measurement method and modal decomposition technique, measurements were first carried out on a small test-rig without flow, with an ordinary loudspeaker as a source. Then the method was tested on an axial fan mounted to the end of a duct. In both cases ten microphone positions, divided equally between two duct cross-sections, were used to separate the waves (five modes) into left- and right-going components. It was verified that the measured source data can be used to predict the sound field created by the fan at a given acoustic load.}

abstract = "Kirchhoff's formula for radiation from a closed surface has been used recently for prediction of the noise of high speed rotors and propellers. Because the closed surface on which the boundary data are prescribed in these cases is in motion, an extension of Kirchhoff's formula to this condition is required. In this paper such a formula, obtained originally by Morgans for the interior problem, is derived for regions exterior to surfaces moving at speeds below the wave propagation speed, by making use of some results of generalized function theory. It is shown that the usual Kirchhoff formula is a special case of the main result of the paper. The general result applieds to a deformable surface. However, the special form it assumes for a rigid surface in motion is also noted. Some possible areas of application of the formula to problems of current interest in aeroacoustics are discussed."

    abstract="Prediction of flow induced noise in the interior of a passenger car requires accurate representations of both fluctuating surface pressures across the exterior
    of the vehicle and efficient models of the vibro-acoustic transmission of these surface pressures to the driver’s ear. In this paper, aeroacoustic and vibro-acoustic
    methods are combined in order to perform an aero-vibro-acoustic analysis of a Mercedes-Benz A-class. The exterior aero-acoustic method consists of a time domain
    incompressible Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and an acoustic wave equation. The method is extended in this paper to account for convection effects when modelling the
    exterior sound propagation. The interior vibro-acoustic model consists of a frequency domain Finite Element (FE) model of the side glass combined with a generalized
    Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) model of the interior cabin. The method is extended in this paper to account for additional geometric details that affect the direct
    and reverberant fields within the cabin. The overall approach is presented and validated against vibro-acoustics tests and wind tunnel measurements for two separate
    mirror designs. The aero-vibro-acoustic method achieves very good results and accurately predicts the change in interior noise resulting from an exterior body design

abstract = {The present paper represents a study on spurious noise generated in direct noise computation using finite volume methods. Different sources of spurious noise are examined as well as the mechanism of their generation. This investigation involves two test cases. The first one consists of a turbulence box convected by a uniform flow field. This case serves to identify spurious noise sources and qualitatively evaluate their relevance. The second test case involves a single side mirror mounted on a flat plate, which serves to quantify the level of spurious noise produced and its relevance compared to physical sound generated by the flow past the mirror. Both test cases are calculated using a compressible flow solver for low Mach-number flows utilised with an IDDES approach for turbulence modelling. A new acoustic damping model which damps out acoustic waves without affecting hydrodynamic turbulent fluctuations has been implemented. Furthermore, special emphasis on refinement interfaces is given. Since no measurements are available, the results of the direct noise computation are compared to the results of a method based on Kirchhoff integral.}

The obvious approach, consistent interpolation, has several drawbacks such as suboptimality, non-conservation, and unsuitability for use with discontinuous discretisations. An alternative, Galerkin projection, remedies these deficiencies; however, its implementation has proven very challenging. This paper presents an algorithm for the local implementation of Galerkin projection of discrete fields between meshes. This algorithm extends naturally to three dimensions and is very efficient."
